\title{Compiled data on avian species abundances at NA BBS sites from
2003 to 2009.}
\format{A \code{data.frame} object with 15863 rows, where each row lists the
abundances of 303 avian species (stored in columns) across sites.  Row order
matches the row orders in the \code{Site.descriptors} and \code{BBS.occurrences} datafiles}
\usage{
data("BBS.abundances")
}
\description{
BBS data for each year was extracted using functions
in the 'pullBBS' package
(i.e. species.df <- pullBBS(year = 2003, country = 840, useCache = T)). The
entire workflow is shown in the \code{Appendix S1} script. Names were then
cleaned and filtered to only include species with names matching to
BirdTree.org using \code{validateSpecies.R}
