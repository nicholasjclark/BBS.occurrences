## Effects of landcover on avian community ecology

This `BBS.occurrences` repository stores functions and datasets for a collaborative project aiming to analyse variation in avian community composition and interspecific 'interactions' using North American Breeding Bird Survey data. Code in the `Appendix S1_CompileBBS` script (within the `Clark_etal_analysis` folder was used for compiling BBS observations from years 2003 - 2009. `Appendix S2_CompileLandcover` outlines how functions in the repository https://github.com/nicholasjclark/LandcoverMODIS were used for accessing 10 x 10km resolution landcover data for each site in each year.
