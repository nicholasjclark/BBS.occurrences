# BBS.occurrences

This repository stores functions and datasets for a collaborative project aiming to analyse variation in avian community composition and interspecific 'interactions' using North American Breeding Bird Survey data. Note that the `Appendix S1_CompileBBS` script was used for compiling
BBS observations from years 2003 - 2009. `Appendix S2_CompileLandcover` outlines how functions in the repository https://github.com/nicholasjclark/LandcoverMODIS were used for accessing 10 x 10km resolution landcover data for each site in each year.
