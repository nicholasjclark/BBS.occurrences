## Effects of landcover on avian community composition and species interactions

This `BBS.occurrences` repository stores functions and datasets for a collaborative project aiming to analyse variation in avian community composition and interspecific 'interactions' using North American Breeding Bird Survey data.   
  
Code in the `Appendix_S1_CompileBBS` script (within the `Clark_etal_analysis` folder) was used for compiling BBS observations from years 2003 - 2009.   
  
`Appendix_S2_CompileLandcover` outlines how functions in the repository https://github.com/nicholasjclark/LandcoverMODIS were used for accessing 10 x 10km resolution landcover data for each site in each year.  
  
`Appendix_S3_FlywayGrouping` demonstrates how we group observation sites into recognised migratory flyways.  
  
`Appendix_S4_PhyloTraitData` describes how avian species' phylogenetic and functional
trait datasets were accessed to create pairwise distance matrices.  
  
`Appendix_S5_PRISMData` describes how to download climate data from the PRISM dataset for each sample observation.  
  
`Appendix_S6_StormData` demonstrates how to download storm data from the NOAA storm events database.  
  
`Appendix_S7_MigrationStatus` shows functions used to scrape BirdLife International for information on species' migratory status.
